# Autolido
Read the complete outline here: [Earning Yield On Lido Staked Assets While Minimizing Price Exposure](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wQ-vzP7TlSUF-PgjePvF3JFit6_0J2Mg8zCSrj5tKfc/edit?usp=sharing)

## Wen release?
Not for a while. First, a development command-line version will be released. For the production launch, there will be a full website & thorough documentation.

### Can I try it right now?
Autolido is nowhere near feature complete yet and won't work as intended.

If you are brave, feel free to test out features and go through the code with [Brownie](https://github.com/eth-brownie/brownie).

### Update 7/8/2022:
This project will migrate from [Brownie](https://github.com/eth-brownie/brownie) to [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) as forking & starting ganache is exceedingly slow as is. Expect delays in development.
